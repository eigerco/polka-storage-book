# Polka Storage Provider

The Polka Storage Provider is comprised of two different binaries, one for the server and one for the client.

The server binary is fairly straight forward, providing a single binary to run all components necessary for running a storage provider,
such as the RPC and HTTP APIs, as well as the proving pipeline.
The client binary provides tools for the server's administration, client's dealings and some demos.

Do not worry, this chapter will go over all that!
