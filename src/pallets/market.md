## Overview

The purpose of the pallet is to manage storage deals between storage market participants and to track their funds.
Market Pallet is tightly coupled with [Storage Provider Pallet](./storage-provider.md) because it's a source of truth for deals.
Storage Provider Pallet cannot exist without deal information from Market Pallet.

## Extrinsics<a href="../glossary.md#extrinsics"><sup>\*</sup></a>

### `add_balance`

Reserves a given amount of currency for usage in the Storage Market.

The reserved amount will be considered `free` until it is used in a deal when moved to `locked` and used to pay for the deal.

| Name     | Description               | Type             |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `amount` | The amount to be reserved | Positive integer |

#### <a id="add_balance.example" href="#add_balance.example" class="header">Example</a>

Using the `storagext-cli` you can add 1000000000[^existential_deposit] [Plancks](../glossary.md#planck) to Alice's account with the following command[^add_balance]:

```bash
storagext-cli --sr25519-key "//Alice" market add-balance 1000000000
```

[^existential_deposit]:
    This value is the minimum amount due to Polkadot's existential deposit.
    You can read more about it at <https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168651-what-is-the-existential-deposit->.

[^add_balance]: Read more about the `add-balance` command in [_Storagext CLI/Subcommand `market`/`add-balance`_](../storagext-cli/market.md#add-balance)

### `withdraw_balance`

Withdraws funds from the Storage Market.

The funds will be withdrawn from the `free` balance, meaning that the `amount` must be
lesser than or equal to `free` and greater than 0 (\\({free} \ge {amount} \gt 0\\)).

| Name     | Description                | Type             |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `amount` | The amount to be withdrawn | Positive integer |

#### <a id="withdraw_balance.example" href="#withdraw_balance.example" class="header">Example</a>

Using the `storagext-cli` you can withdraw 10000 [Plancks](../glossary.md#planck) from Alice's `free` balance using the following command[^withdraw_balance]:

```bash
storagext-cli --sr25519-key "//Alice" market withdraw-balance 10000
```

[^withdraw_balance]: Read more about the `withdraw-balance` command in [_Storagext CLI/Subcommand `market`/`withdraw-balance`_](../storagext-cli/market.md#withdraw-balance)

### `publish_storage_deals`

Publishes list of deals to the chain.

This extrinsic _must_ be called by a storage provider.

| Name               | Description                                     | Type                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proposal`         | Specific deal proposal, a JSON object           | JSON object, specified in the [next section](#deal-proposal-components)                                                                                                                                     |
| `client_signature` | Client signature of this specific deal proposal | [`MultiSignature`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sp_runtime/enum.MultiSignature.html), meaning a 64-byte array for Sr25519 and Ed25519 signatures and 65-byte array for ECDSA signatures |

The `client_signature`, as the name indicates, is generated by the client by signing the deal proposal with their private key —
the [`storagext-cli`](../storagext-cli/index.md) does this for the user automatically[^warn].
This signature ensures that the storage provider cannot forge a deal with an arbitrary client.
The type of signature is dependent on the key the signer has, currently supported key types are Sr25519, ECDSA and Ed25519.

_This step corresponds to the "sign & send proposal" step in the [deal overview](./index.md#figure-overview)._

#### <a id="publish_storage_deals.example" href="#publish_storage_deals.example" class="header">Example</a>

Using the `storagext-cli` you can publish deals with `//Alice` as the storage provider and `//Charlie` as the client by running the following command[^publish_storage_deals]:

```bash
storagext-cli --sr25519-key "//Alice" market publish-storage-deals \
  --client-sr25519-key "//Charlie" \
  "@deals.json"
```

Where `deals.json` is a file with contents similar to:

```json

]
```

<div class="warning">
Notice how the CLI command doesn't take the <code>client_signature</code> parameter but a keypair that can sign it.

We are aware that this is **not secure**. However, the system is still under development
and is **not final**; it is a testing tool.

</div>

[^storage_price_per_block]: The formula to calculate the total price is as follows: \\[total\\\_price = (end\\\_block - start\\\_block) * storage\\_price\\_per\\_block\\]
[^publish_storage_deals]: Read more about the `publish-storage-deals` command in [_Storagext CLI/Subcommand `market`/`publish-storage-deals`_](../storagext-cli/market.md#publish-storage-deals)
[^warn]: Take into account that the CLI is currently for demo purposes, the authors are aware that the command isn't safe since it requires the private keys of both parties.

### `settle_deal_payments`

Settle specified deals between providers and clients.

Both clients and providers can call this extrinsic.
However, since the settlement is the mechanism through which the provider gets paid,
a client has no reason to call this extrinsic.
Non-existing deal IDs will be ignored.

| Name       | Description                        | Type              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `deal_ids` | List of the deal IDs to be settled | Array of integers |

#### <a id="settle_deal_payments.example" href="#settle_deal_payments.example" class="header">Example</a>

Using the `storagext-cli` you can settle deal payments for IDs 97, 1010, 1337 and 42069 using the following command[^settle_deal_payments]:

```bash
storagext-cli --sr25519-key "//Alice" market settle-deal-payments 97 1010 1337 42069
```

[^settle_deal_payments]: Read more about the `settle-deal-payments` command in [_Storagext CLI/Subcommand `market`/`settle-deal-payments`_](../storagext-cli/market.md#settle-deal-payments)

## Events

The Market Pallet emits the following events:

  - `who` - SS58 address of then account which added balance
  - `amount` - Amount added
- `BalanceWithdrawn` - Some balance was transferred (free) from the Market Account to the Participant's account.
  - `who` - SS58 address of the account which had withdrawn the balance
  - `amount` - Amount withdrawn

  - `deal_id` - Unique deal ID
  - `client` - SS58 address of the storage client
  - `provider` - SS58 address of the storage provider
- `DealsSettled` - Published after the `settle_deal_payments` extrinsic is called. Indicates which deals were successfully and unsuccessfully settled.
  - `successful` - List of deal IDs that were settled
  - `unsuccessful` - List of deal IDs with the corresponding errors

## Errors

The Market Pallet actions can fail with following errors:

- `InsufficientFreeFunds` - Market participants do not have enough free funds.
- `NoProposalsToBePublished` - `publish_storage_deals` was called with an empty list of `deals`.
- `ProposalsNotPublishedByStorageProvider` - Is returned when calling `publish_storage_deals` and the deals in a list are not published by the same storage provider.
- `AllProposalsInvalid` - `publish_storage_deals` call was supplied with a list of `deals` which are all invalid.
- `DuplicateDeal` - There is more than one deal with this ID in the Sector.
- `DealNotFound` - Tried to activate a deal that is not in the system.
- `DealActivationError` - Tried to activate a deal, but data was malformed.
  - Invalid specified provider.
  - The deal already expired.
  - Sector containing the deal expires before the deal.
  - Invalid deal state.
  - Deal is not pending.
- `DealsTooLargeToFitIntoSector` - Sum of all deals piece sizes for a sector exceeds sector size. The sector size is based on the registered proof type. We currently only support registered `StackedDRG2KiBV1P1` proofs, which have 2KiB sector sizes.
- `TooManyDealsPerBlock` - Tried to activate too many deals at a given `start_block`.
- `UnexpectedValidationError` - `publish_storage_deals`'s core logic was invoked with a broken invariant that `validate_deals` should call. Report an issue if you receive this error.
- `DealPreconditionFailed` - Due to a programmer bug. Report an issue if you receive this error.
