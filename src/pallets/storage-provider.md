## Overview

The `Storage Provider Pallet` handles the creation of storage providers and facilitates storage providers and clients in creating storage deals.
Storage providers must provide the [Proof of Space-time (PoSt)](../glossary.md#post) and the [Proof of Replication (PoRep)](../glossary.md#porep)
to the `Storage Provider Pallet` to prevent the pallet from imposing penalties on storage providers through [slashing](#storage-fault-slashing).

## Usage

### Declaring storage faults and recoveries

Faulty sectors are subject to penalties. To minimize said penalties, the storage provider should declare any sector for which they cannot
generate a [PoSt](../glossary.md#post) as faulty, this will mask said sectors in future deadlines, minimizing the suffered penalties.
A storage provider must declare the sector as faulty [**before**](#fault-declaration-cutoff) the challenge window.

Through the [`declare_faults`](#declare_faults) and [`declare_faults_recovered`](#declare_faults_recovered) extrinsics
the storage provider can declare sectors as faulty or recovered[^recovered].

[^recovered]: Recovered sectors still require being proven before they can become fully active again.

Substrate pallet hooks execute actions when certain conditions are met.

Substrate pallet hooks execute some actions when certain conditions are met.
We use these hooks — when a block finalizes — to check if storage providers are up to date with their proofs.
If a storage provider fails to submit proof on time, the Storage Provider pallet will signal the Market pallet to penalize the storage provider.
Accordingly, removing and burning the collateral locked up during the pre-commit.

## Extrinsics

### `register_storage_provider`

Storage Provider registration is the first extrinsic any storage provider must call. Without being registered, other extrinsics will return an error.

Before a storage provider can register, they must set up a [PeerId](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/peers/#peer-id). This [PeerId](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/peers/#peer-id) is used in the p2p network to connect to the storage provider.

| Name                     | Description                                                                            | Type                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `window_post_proof_type` | Proof type the storage provider uses                                                   | String, currently only `StackedDRGWindow2KiBV1P1` is available |

#### <a class="header" id="register_storage_provider.example" href="#register_storage_provider.example">Example</a>

Registering a storage provider with keypair `//Alice` and peer ID `alice` with the following command[^register_storage_provider]:

```bash
storagext-cli --sr25519-key "//Alice" storage-provider register alice
```

### `pre_commit_sector`

After publishing a deal, the storage provider needs to pre-commit the sector information to the chain.
Sectors are not valid after pre-commit. The sectors need to be proven first.

| Name            | Description                                                            | Type                                                           |

| `deal_ids`      | Deal IDs to be pre-committed, from `publish_storage_deals`             | Array of integers                                              |
| `expiration`    | Expiration block of the pre-committed sector                           | Positive integer                                               |

<div class="warning">
Sectors are not valid after pre-commit. The sectors need to be proven first.
</div>

[^note]: Only one seal-proof type supported at the moment, `2KiB`.

### `prove_commit_sector`

After pre-committing some new sectors the storage provider needs to supply a [Proof-of-Replication](../glossary.md#commitment-of-replication) for these sectors [^note].

| Name            | Description                                                          | Type                          |

This example follows up on the pre-commit example. Storage provider `//Alice` is proven committing[^prove_commit_sector] sector number 1.

```bash

```

Where `prove-commit-sector.json` is a file with contents similar to:

```json

}
```

### `submit_windowed_post`

A storage provider needs to periodically submit a [Proof-of-Spacetime](../glossary.md#proofs) to prove that they are still storing the data they promised. Multiple proofs can be submitted at once.

| Name          | Description                                                               | Type                                                           |

### `declare_faults`

A storage provider can declare faults when they know they cannot submit PoSt on time to prevent getting penalized.
Faults have an expiry of 42 days.
The sectors will be terminated if the faults have not been recovered before this time.
Multiple faults can be declared at once.

`declare_faults` can take in multiple fault declarations:

| Name     | Description            | Type                                             |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `faults` | The fault declarations | Array of the fault declarations, described below |

Where the fault declarations contain:

| Name        | Description                                                        | Type                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `deadline`  | The deadline to which the faulty sectors are assigned              | Positive integer         |

Where `fault-declaration.json` is a file with contents similar to:

```json
[
  {
    "deadline": 0,
    "partition": 0,
    "sectors": [1]
  }
]
```

[^declare_faults]: Read more about the `declare-faults` command in [_Storagext CLI/Subcommand `storage-provider`/`declare-faults`_](../storagext-cli/storage-provider.md#declare-faults)

### `declare_faults_recovered`

After declaring sectors as faulty, a storage provider can recover them.
The storage provider must recover the faults if the system has marked some sectors as faulty due to a missing PoSt.
Faults are not fully recovered until the storage provider submits a valid PoSt after the `declare_faults_recovered` extrinsic.

`declare_faults_recovered` can take in multiple fault recoveries:

| Name         | Description          | Type                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recoveries` | The fault recoveries | Array of the fault recovery declarations, described below |

Where the fault recoveries contain:

| Name        | Description                                                          | Type                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `deadline`  | The deadline to which the recovered sectors are assigned             | Positive integer         |
| `partition` | Partition index within the deadline containing the recovered sectors | Positive integer         |
| `sectors`   | Sectors in the partition being declared recovered                    | Set of positive integers |
